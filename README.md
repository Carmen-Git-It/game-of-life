# game-of-life
My just-for-fun Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

Run GUI_game.py for the GUI version of the game. 

Console implementation of the game was left unfinished,
but can be used if desired.

There are currently no options for user input. They're the
next item on the list of things to do.
